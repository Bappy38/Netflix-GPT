# A pet project to explore React!

This is basically a dashboard like Netflix. I focused only on frontend in this project as I have strong profeciency in backend already!

## What I have explored about React doing this project?

- Functional Component
- Hooks:
    - React Hooks: `useRef`, `useEffect`
    - React Router DOM Hooks: `useNavigate`
- Creating Custom Hooks
- Routing
- Form Validation

## What I have explored apart from React?

- Tailwind CSS
- Redux Store
- Firebase (Authentication, Deployment)
- Third Party API Integration (TMDB)
